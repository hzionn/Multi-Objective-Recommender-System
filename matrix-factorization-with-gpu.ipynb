I talk a bit more about this idea here: [💡 What is the co-visitation matrix, really?](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/otto-recommender-system/discussion/365358).\n","\n","But matrix factorization has a lot of advantages as compared to co-visitation matrices. First of all, it can make better use of data -- it operates on the notion of similarity between categories. We can construct a more powerful representation if our model understands that aid `1` is similar to aid `142` as opposed to it treating each aid as an atomic entity (this is the jump from unigram/bigram/trigram models to word2vec in NLP).\n","\n","Let us thus train a matrix factorization model and replace the co-visitation matrices with it!\n","\n","Now, I don't expect that the first version of the model will be particularly well tuned. There has already been a lot of work put into co-visitation matrices and in the later versions we work off 3 different matrices, one for each category of actions! A similar progression can and will happen with matrix factorization 🙂 This notebook hopefully will enable us to jumpstart this type of exploration 🙂\n","\n","To streamline the work, we will use data in `parquet` format. (Here is the notebook [💡 [Howto] Full dataset as parquet/csv files](https://www.kaggle.com/code/radek1/howto-full-dataset-as-parquet-csv-files) and here is [the most up-to-date version of the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/radek1/otto-full-optimized-memory-footprint), no need for dealing with `jasonl` files and the associated mess any longer! Please upvote if you find this useful!)\n","\n","For data processing we will use [polars](https://www.pola.rs/). `Polars` has a much smaller memory footprint than `pandas` and is quite fast. Plus it has really clean, intuitive API.\n","\n","Let's get to work! 🙂\n","\n","\n","## Other resources you might find useful:\n","\n","* [💡 Training an XGBoost Ranker on the GPU with Merlin Models 🔥🔥🔥](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/otto-recommender-system/discussion/368848)\n","* [How to train a Word2Vec model 🚀🚀🚀](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/otto-recommender-system/discussion/368384)\n","* [💡 Can you beat static rules with a ranker model without additional features?](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/otto-recommender-system/discussion/366474)\n","* [🐘 the elephant in the room -- high cardinality of targets and what to do about this](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/otto-recommender-system/discussion/364722)\n","* [📖 What are some good resources to learn about how gradient-boosted tree ranking models work?](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/otto-recommender-system/discussion/366477)\n","* [💡How to ensemble predictions -- a key component to every strong solution 🏅](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/otto-recommender-system/discussion/368747)\n","* [from zero to 60 in 2 seconds or less 🏎️🚓🚓🚓](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/otto-recommender-system/discussion/367058)\n","* [💡What is a good initial goal in the competition?
